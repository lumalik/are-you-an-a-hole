# Are you an A-hole? 
-- This is a work in progress -- <br/> 
The aim of this project is to create a moral compass for reddit, distinguishing Assholes from not Assholes.

## What is it about? 
The subreddit describes itself as: "A catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us, and a place to finally find out if you were wrong in an argument that's been bothering you. Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you're right, or you're the asshole."

## Example Submission

Title : AITA for not allowing my best friend to crash at my house after his wife died? 

&nbsp;

Body : My best friend Jake's wife died about a month ago in a car crash and he's handling it terribly. He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.
A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything.
Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive asshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA?
Edit: Thanks, reading all your responses have shed a lot of light on how what I did was terrible and came off as me not caring about him. I'll go talk to him a few hours from now and apologize & let him stay here if he needs. I'll discuss his living situation and if he can't stay in his house I'll see what I can do.

Title: AITA for taking on a job offer in South Korea and moving away from my parents?

&nbsp;

Body: Trying to keep this short. I recently managed to get a job offer in South Korea. Moving there has kind of been a dream of mine for a long time, I just love it there, love the culture, the night life, the beautiful women, the food, and so on. I even took Korean classes in college and after graduating I went there on vacation once.
After telling my family (don't have a girlfriend atm since we broke up not too long ago so just my family like siblings and my parents) my parents later claimed that this came totally unexpected and that I was being selfish. They said now they'd rarely if ever see their grandkids (although two of my siblings already have kids) and said I should stay here and find someone to marry here instead.
Now I don't really think I'm doing anything wrong, I'm just doing what I think is the best for me, and I'm 28, it's not like I'm a child who has to aim to please his parents. AITA still? I mean I did never mention these plans to them so it might have come as a bit of a surprise but still.
